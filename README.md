# Customer Analytics: Cycling Trips Analysis

A comprehensive data analysis project examining bike-sharing trip patterns, user demographics, and behavioral insights using Python.

## 📊 Project Overview

This project analyzes bike-sharing trip data to understand customer behavior, trip patterns, and user demographics. The analysis includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical testing, data visualization, and insights generation for business decision-making.

## 📖 Data Source

This dataset and analysis context are extracted from:

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python Version**: 3.13 (Latest as of December 2025)
- **Libraries**:
  - pandas - Data manipulation and analysis
  - numpy - Numerical computations
  - matplotlib - Data visualization
  - seaborn - Statistical visualizations
  - scipy - Statistical testing

## 📈 Analysis Includes

- **Data Cleaning**: Missing value handling, duplicate detection, outlier identification
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Distribution analysis, temporal patterns, demographic insights
- **Statistical Testing**: Homogeneity tests (Levene's, Bartlett's), group comparisons
- **Visualizations**: Box plots, bar charts, pair plots, stacked bar charts, heatmaps
- **Business Insights**: User type behavior, age demographics, gender distribution, trip patterns

## 🔍 Key Features

- User type segmentation (Customer vs Subscriber)
- Trip duration analysis and outlier detection
- Age and gender demographic profiling
- Station usage patterns
- Temporal analysis of trip data
- Statistical homogeneity testing

## 📝 Dataset Variables

- `trip_id`: Unique identifier for each trip
- `starttime`/`stoptime`: Trip timestamps
- `bikeid`: Bike identifier
- `tripduration`: Duration in seconds
- `from_station_name`/`to_station_name`: Station locations
- `usertype`: Customer or Subscriber
- `gender`: User gender
- `birthyear`: Year of birth

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
```
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scipy jupyter
```

### Running the Analysis
1. Clone this repository
2. Open `Trips_Analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
3. Run all cells to reproduce the analysis

## 📊 Key Findings

- Detailed insights available in the notebook
- User behavior differs significantly between Customers and Subscribers
- Trip duration variance is heterogeneous across user groups
- Core user demographic: Ages 30-45 (born 1980s-1990s)
